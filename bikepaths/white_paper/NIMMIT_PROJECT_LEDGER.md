# NIMMIT PROJECT LEDGER

This document serves as the central "Source of Truth" for the Nimmit platform evolution. It tracks the technical architecture, strategic milestones, and document locations.

---

## 1. Project Pillars
- **Micro-Entity Economy**: Scaling one-person businesses without traditional employment.
- **Context Cloud**: Decoupling institutional memory from labor using Vector Databases (**Transactive Memory**).
- **Agentic Orchestration**: The 80/20 division of labor between AI (Friction) and Humans (Judgment).
- **Reliability Arbitrage**: Competing on consistent high-quality outcomes rather than low-cost labor.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Dynamic Development**: All project documents (White Paper, Blog Series, and Notes) are **Dynamic Drafts**. As we gather new notes and synthesize big ideas, they are continuously incorporated into all core documents. Everything is evolving in real-time.

> [!NOTE]
> **Style Protocol (Italicized Minimalist v3)**:
> - **Header Level**: Use Title Case for `###` article headers. No H1/H2.
> - **Emphasis**: Use *italics* for conceptual terms.
> - **Case Sensitivity**: Strictly lowercase for terms mid-sentence (*friction trap*, *transaction costs*, *context cloud*). Use caps only for proper nouns or sentence starts.
> - **Zero Quotation**: Absolutely no quotation marks around terms or common phrases. Zero.
> - **No Bolding**: No bold text in the body. Use structure and italics for prominence.
