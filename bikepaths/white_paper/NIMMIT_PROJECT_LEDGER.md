# NIMMIT PROJECT LEDGER

This document serves as the central "Source of Truth" for the Nimmit platform evolution. It tracks the technical architecture, strategic milestones, and document locations.

---

## 1. Project Pillars
- **Micro-Entity Economy**: Scaling one-person businesses without traditional employment.
- **Context Cloud**: Decoupling institutional memory from labor using Vector Databases (**Transactive Memory**).
- **Agentic Orchestration**: The 80/20 division of labor between AI (Friction) and Humans (Judgment).
- **Reliability Arbitrage**: Competing on consistent high-quality outcomes rather than low-cost labor.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Dynamic Development**: All project documents (White Paper, Blog Series, and Notes) are **Dynamic Drafts**. As we gather new notes and synthesize big ideas, they are continuously incorporated into all core documents. Everything is evolving in real-time.

> [!NOTE]
> **Style Protocol (Minimalist v4)**:
> - **Header Level**: Title Case for `###` headers.
> - **Emphasis**: *Italics* for mid-sentence conceptual terms (ESL special meaning signal).
> - **List Anchors**: **Bold and Title Case** for the lead term in any list (e.g., **1. Infinite Capacity**).
> - **Engineer's Stance**:
    - **Affirmative Framing**: Define what a concept IS. Never use "not just about" or "is not X."
    - **No Contractions**: Write all words in full (e.g., "do not" instead of "don't").
    - **No Dashes**: Never use em-dashes (—) or en-dashes (–). Use commas or periods.
    - **Vocabulary**: Use skill-based verbs (*precision*, *orchestration*). Avoid machine language.
- **Glossary Style**: **Bold Title Case**: followed by the definition.
- **Zero Quotation**: No quotation marks.
