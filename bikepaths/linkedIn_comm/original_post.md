After years building tech in Cambodia, I've learned one thing: talent here is wildly underestimated.

So I'm testing something new—AI-powered virtual assistants with a Cambodian team. But I don't know what to charge or what people actually need help with.

So here's what I'm thinking:
Send me a real project you need done. Could be:
- Excel dashboards & data analysis
- Web/app development
- Video editing & graphic design
- E-commerce store management
- Social media content creation
- Bookkeeping & financial reports
- Research & competitive intelligence
- API integrations & automation
- Customer support systems
- Or something else entirely

We'll do it for free. When it's done, just tell me honestly:
- Was it good enough?
- What would you actually pay for this?
- Would you come back for more?

Why I need your help:
 I'm trying to figure out what projects work well remotely from Cambodia, where AI actually helps, and what fair pricing looks like in 2026. I could guess, but I'd rather just ask people who need work done.

What I'm asking: Give me something you genuinely need completed. Not a test project—something real that's been sitting on your list.

I'll take 10 people this month. DM me or comment with what you need.

this one was a realization of talents in Cambodia is under utilized. Let draw a connection from KOOMPI that we have been working on educational tech that aim to empowered students to learn tech via open source and linux but most educator argue that learning via open source won't get them job. They insist that students should learn with microsoft and words/excel admin stuffs. We argue that students should learn computer regardless of platform. They should know how to use a computer and not scare of changing platform from what they are used to.

Learn creative and critical thinking via open source platform such as Linux along with AI guide offer them an edge in the future.

With Nimmit come in to offer opportunity for those creative talents that are scares of something new and not platform locked in

 want a more philosophical discussion and argument that the next gen. doesn't need to follow the old for learning new skills. Most of the time the new gen. are limited opportunities by their teachers' limited knowledge and thinking level.

I want to argue that teachers should act as guide for students to explore and learn, not to teach but learn how to guide students.

a series of that would get the conversation steer up

Let's continue with the next draft in this series.
