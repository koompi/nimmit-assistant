# NIMMIT PROJECT LEDGER

This document serves as the central "Source of Truth" for the Nimmit platform evolution. It tracks the technical architecture, strategic milestones, and document locations.

---

## 1. Project Pillars
- **Micro-Entity Economy**: Scaling one-person businesses without traditional employment.
- **Context Cloud**: Decoupling institutional memory from labor using Vector Databases (**Transactive Memory**).
- **Agentic Orchestration**: The 80/20 division of labor between AI (Friction) and Humans (Judgment).
- **Reliability Arbitrage**: Competing on consistent high-quality outcomes rather than low-cost labor.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Dynamic Development**: All project documents are "Dynamic Drafts." As new research and notes are gathered, they are incorporated into the White Paper and Blog Series. The project is in a state of continuous evolution.
