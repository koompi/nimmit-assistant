## Article 1: The New Way to Work: What is a Micro-Entity?
*   **Simple Question**: Can you run a big business all by yourself?
*   **Narrative**: Introduction to the "Micro-Entity." You are an expert at what you do (design, code, writing), but you are drowning in small tasks.

*   **Glossary Link**: Micro-Entity.

## Article 2: The Time Trap: Why Hiring is Slow (and How to Fix It)
*   **Simple Question**: Why does it take so long to explain things to freelancers?
*   **Narrative**: Explain the "Friction Trap." If you spend 2 hours explaining a 2-hour task, you wasted your day.

*   **Glossary Link**: Agentic Pod, Orchestrator.

## Article 6: Your Global Team: Starting at the Phnom Penh Hub
